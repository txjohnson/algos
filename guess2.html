<h1>Numberator</h1>
<p>
Think of a number between 1 and 100. I will try to guess it, but you need to tell me if the number is too high, too low or just right.

<button onclick="correct()">Correct</button>
<button onclick="tooLow()">Its too low</button>
<button onclick="tooHigh()">Its too high</button>

let l = 1;

// set g to the average of the range
